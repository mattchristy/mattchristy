- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattchristy
- 👀 I’m interested in spending time with my family, feedng my family while bbqing or smoking meats, playing video games and flying my drone around for some great photos.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything from D3 to bootstrap to Python to R.  I want to build my knowledge for web design and development, along with data visualization and manipulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data visualizations or web designs to learn to use GitHub and help where I can.
- 📫 How to reach me, best via email: matthewchristy6271@gmail.com
